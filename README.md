# Project Enhancement: Code Refactoring & Conversion
In this project, we focus on improving the ebfEcho and ebfComp code by enhancing modularity and reusability. We aim to fix logic errors, implement 2D arrays, introduce new utilities, and handle format conversions. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of our objectives and techniques used:

# Objectives
Code Refactoring: Our primary goal is to refactor the existing code in ebfEcho and ebfComp for enhanced modularity. This ensures that the codebase becomes more organized, manageable, and adaptable.

Logic Fixes: Identifying and addressing logic errors is crucial for improving the functionality of the code. By rectifying these errors, we strive to achieve a more reliable and efficient codebase.

2D Array Implementation: We plan to incorporate 2D arrays to facilitate successful test completions. This update helps ensure that the code aligns with the required specifications and passes the necessary tests.

New Utility Development: To enhance versatility, we're introducing ebuEcho and ebuComp utilities. These utilities will enable efficient handling of the ebu format, contributing to a more comprehensive and adaptable codebase.

Format Conversion: We're implementing essential utilities - ebf2ebu, ebu2ebf, ebc2ebu, and ebu2ebc - to provide seamless format conversions. These utilities enable smooth transitions between different file formats.

Debugging Mastery: We're leveraging the gdb debugger to meticulously identify errors within the code. This approach ensures that our codebase is thoroughly scrutinized and optimized.

Modularity Focus: A critical aspect of this project involves segregating c and header files. This modularity promotes better code organization, ease of maintenance, and reusability.

Binary Data Handling: We're addressing uncompressed EBU files and effectively handling compressed EBC files. This step ensures that our code is well-equipped to manage various file formats.

Effective Compression: Our aim is to achieve an impressive 60% reduction in file size through 5-bit binary compression. This optimization enhances storage efficiency while maintaining data integrity.

Efficient Bit Manipulation: We'll skillfully utilize bit twiddling techniques to ensure optimal binary writing. This approach contributes to code efficiency and accuracy.

Thorough Testing: Rigorous testing is essential. We'll employ predefined and custom test cases to thoroughly evaluate our code's functionality, robustness, and adherence to specifications.

GitHub Proficiency: We'll adeptly utilize Git branching techniques for effective project management. This ensures that our codebase remains organized, version-controlled, and collaborative.

# Conclusion
Through this comprehensive enhancement process, we aim to create a refined and efficient codebase for ebfEcho and ebfComp. Our focus on modularity, logic correction, and format conversion ensures a versatile and adaptable solution.
